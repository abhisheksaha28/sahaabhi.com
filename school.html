    <h1><b><u>My Second School</u></b></h1>
    <p>After class 8 I changed my school. In Class 9 I moved to Sri Sri Ravishankar Vidya Mandir</p>
    <p>Here in this school I studied from class 9 to class 12. I had given my AISSE and AISSCE from this school. Many new friends and many new endless and evergreen memories of school life werw made in this school. From class bunking to passing board examinatuons with bright colours , all happened in this school.From getting scolded by teachers to getting appraisals from them , all these bitter-sweet memories were created in this school.
